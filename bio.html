<p>I was born on the 27th of march, in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castro_Valley,_California"> Castro Valley, California</a>. to Brenda and Bobbey Cathcart. growing up i 
always wanted to figure out how things work. i used to take things apart for fun. i never was good at putting them back together. </p>
<p>i love programing and have been exsposed to computers from a young age. luckly i am part of the genaration that can say that. i have always had a fasination with the idea of putting somthing in to a computer and somthing else come out. i wish i had more oportunity as a kid to learn more about computers and programing.</p>
