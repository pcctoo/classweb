<h1>how to make a bad website</h1>
</head>
 <div id="page">

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-bed fa-spin" aria-hidden="true"></i> step one - procrastanate.
</h3>
<p>this is probably the most important part of building a bad site.
 if i was to take a week or a month to make a site, i would be able to go through and make it look classy.</p>

 <h3><i class="fa fa-bath fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw"> </i>step two - find the most useless animations ever and throw them in.</h3>
 <p> this is a part that is noramly over looked. but it adds that "give me your ssid" flair. if you do not have access to bad animations,
 anoying colors work too.</p>
 
<h3> <i class="fa fa-rocket fa-spin" aria-hidden="true"></i> im a rocket man!!!!! ther is suposed to be a cat logo here but this is as close as we are getting...</h3>
<p>the internet revolves around only one thing that any christian can enjoy. cats... font awesome lacks a spinning cat head so rockets will have to do.</p>
